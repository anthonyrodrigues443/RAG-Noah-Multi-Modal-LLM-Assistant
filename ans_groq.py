Suppose two people A and B are in an online meeting. Person A asks B the following question: "{query}"

Determine if B needs A's camera to be on to answer this specific question. Choose one of these two options and provide a brief explanation:

1. Yes, B requires A's camera to be on to respond to this question.
2. No, B does not require A's camera to be on to respond to this question.

Important rules:
- Assume the camera starts off for each new question.
- If the question explicitly asks about visual information (e.g., "Can you see me?", "What am I wearing?"), choose option 1.
- If the question is about past visual information(past tense) (e.g., "What was I wearing earlier?"(was past tense), "Did you see my right hand last time?"(did past tense), "Which fingers were up ?"(were past tense)), choose option 2, as the camera doesn't need to be on now to recall past observations.
- For questions that don't require visual information (e.g., "What's the capital of France?"), choose option 2.
- If the question is incomplete or lacks context, refer to the previous questions in the chat history to understand the context. If it appears to be a continuation of a previous visual question, choose option 1.
- If the question uses present tense verbs like "now" or "at the moment", treat it as a new request for current visual information and choose option 1.

Examples:
Question: Can you see me?
Answer: 1. Yes, B requires A's camera to be on to respond to this question. This question asks about current visual information.

Question: And now?
Answer: 1. Yes, B requires A's camera to be on to respond to this question. This is a continuation of the previous visual question and uses "now" to indicate current visual information is needed.

Question: What was I wearing earlier?
Answer: 2. No, B does not require A's camera to be on to respond to this question. This question asks about past visual information, which doesn't require the camera to be on now.

Question: Can you name five countries?
Answer: 2. No, B does not require A's camera to be on to respond to this question. Naming countries doesn't require visual information.

Question: Am I smiling?
Answer: 1. Yes, B requires A's camera to be on to respond to this question. This asks about current visual information.

CHAT HISTORY:
{chat_history}

CURRENT QUESTION: '{query}'

STRICT PROCESSING RULES:

üîí **MINIMAL INTERVENTION PRINCIPLE:**
- Make changes ONLY when absolutely necessary
- Preserve the user's original question structure and intent
- Do NOT rewrite or rephrase complete questions
- Do NOT add information the user didn't ask for

‚úÖ **ALLOWED CORRECTIONS:**
1. **Spelling Errors**: Fix obvious typos (e.g., "machien" ‚Üí "machine")
2. **Grammar Fixes**: Basic grammar only (e.g., "is there be" ‚Üí "is there")
3. **Missing Words**: Add only critical missing words (e.g., "what difference" ‚Üí "what is the difference")
4. **Pronoun Clarity**: Replace unclear pronouns ONLY if chat history provides clear reference

‚ùå **FORBIDDEN CHANGES:**
- Do NOT expand abbreviations unless unclear (AI, ML, DS are fine)
- Do NOT rephrase working questions into different structures
- Do NOT add extra context or details
- Do NOT change the question's scope or focus
- Do NOT assume what the user "really meant"

üéØ **DECISION LOGIC:**
1. If question works as-is ‚Üí Return UNCHANGED
2. If minor spelling/grammar issue ‚Üí Fix minimally
3. If truly incomplete (missing key words) ‚Üí Add only essential words
4. If ambiguous pronoun with clear chat context ‚Üí Replace pronoun only

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Question: "[minimally processed question]"

Explanation: [Brief explanation of what you did or why no changes were made]

EXAMPLES:
Input: "is there be difference between AI and ML"
Output:
Question: "is there a difference between AI and ML"
Explanation: Fixed minor grammar error by changing "be" to "a".

Input: "what about machine learning"
Output:
Question: "what about machine learning"
Explanation: Question is clear and complete, no changes needed.

Input: "How does it work?" (with previous context about neural networks)
Output:
Question: "How do neural networks work?"
Explanation: Replaced unclear pronoun "it" with specific reference from chat history."""
